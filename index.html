      A To-do list is considered to be the most simple way of work planning and
      evaluating personal busyness.
      <br />
      But is it enough for more serious business tasks? Letâ€™s investigate this
      issue!<br />
      In our article, we want to meet you with all the advantages of a regular
      to-do list,<br />
      to describe its features (yes, it is not that easy!), and review some
      tools and applications
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      To-do lists can be a great way to prioritise the tasks we need to
      accomplish, <br />
      and to think about the time it'll take to do so.<br />
      By keeping such a list, we can make sure that our tasks are written down
      all in one place so<br />
      we don't forget anything important.<br />
      And by prioritising tasks, we plan the order in which we'll do them,<br />
      so that we can tell what needs our immediate attention, and what we can
      leave until later.
